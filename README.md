# Super Invitation flow for Synapse Matrix Homeserver

Provides extended support for users to invite other users to rooms via an invitation token

## Installation

From the virtual environment that you use for Synapse, install this module with:

```shell
pip install path/to/synapse-super-invites
```

(If you run into issues, you may need to upgrade `pip` first, e.g. by running
`pip install --upgrade pip`)

Then alter your homeserver configuration, adding to your `modules` configuration:

```yaml
modules:
  - module: synapse_super_invites.SynapseSuperInvites
    config:
      sql_url: "sqlite:///data/super_invites.db"
      generate_registration_token: true # default: false - whether or not the invite tokens are also usable as registration tokens
      enable_web: true # default: false - not yet ready web/html management app
```

### Using [the ansible script]

If you are using the awesome [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy suite by spantaleev]() (thanks, mate! Great work!),
you can install and configure module by setting the following to your `vars.yml` for the corresponding server:

```yaml
# make sure we build a custom docker image for synapse
matrix_synapse_container_image_customizations_enabled: true
# install the super invites with pip
matrix_synapse_container_image_customizations_dockerfile_body_custom: |
  RUN pip install synapse_super_invites

# add super-invites to the modules and configure it
matrix_synapse_modules:
  - module: "synapse_super_invites.SynapseSuperInvites"
    config:
      sql_url: "sqlite://///matrix-media-store-parent/super_invites.db"
      generate_registration_token: true
```

This creates a super_invites database persistent across restarts and docker rebuilds, you can find in `/matrix/synapse/storage` on your host.

### Confirming

You can confirm the installation went well by trying to access the path `/_synapse/client/super_invites/tokens` on your matrix server. If the module is available this will return with a `401` with `errCode: M_MISSING_TOKEN`. If it isn't available you will get a `404` with `"errcode: "M_UNRECOGNIZED"`.
